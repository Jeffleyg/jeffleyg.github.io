<p>Hello, I'm <b>Jeffley Garçon</b>, a dedicated Computer Science student at <b>Universidade Federal da Fronteira Sul</b>. I'm currently delving into the world of software development through an exciting internship at Compass UOL, where I'm mainly focused on Back-end with Spring Boot.

    My portfolio reflects my journey and learning so far. In it, you will find a variety of projects that demonstrate my mastery of various technologies and fundamental concepts in software development. From web applications to automation solutions, each project is an opportunity for me to explore new challenges and expand my skill set.
    
    My goal is to not only develop functional solutions, but also ensure they are efficient, scalable and robust. I am constantly seeking to learn and improve myself, whether through online courses, participating in hackathons or collaborating with teammates.
    
    I'm excited to share my work with you and I'm open to feedback and collaboration opportunities. Together, we can create innovative and impactful solutions. Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and don't hesitate to get in touch!</p>
